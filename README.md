![portada](https://github.com/Fominayasg/geospatial-data-project/blob/main/images/portada.jpg)

This project has been developed in the context of Ironhack's data analysis bootcamp.

## Project objectives

The main goal is to find the optimus location to place a new videogames company. 

The workforce consists of the following employees:

- 20 Designers
- 5 UI/UX Engineers
- 10 Frontend Developers
- 15 Data Engineers
- 5 Backend Developers
- 20 Account Managers
- 1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball
- 10 Executives
- 1 CEO/President

It has been shown that the happier the staff is, the more productive the company is, therefore we will take into account the following requirements.

- Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
- 30% of the company staff have at least 1 child.
- Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
- Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.
- Account managers need to travel a lot.
- Everyone in the company is between 25 and 40, give them some place to go party.
- The CEO is vegan.
- If you want to make the maintenance guy happy, a basketball stadium must be around 10 Km.
- The office dogâ€”"Dobby" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away.


It will probably be difficult to find a place that satisfies all requests, so we will consider as a priority:
- Being close to other technology companies since most of the staff is made up of developers.
- That the office pet is well cared.
- That there are schools nearby so that employees can reconcile family life.

If you want to find out the final location, have a look at the repository.

## Repository structure

The repository is constructed in such a way that the final location selection process can be continued using the numbered notebooks in the main folder.

In the src folder you will find the files with the functions used throughout the process.

In the data one, you will find the outputs with the data obtained throughout the process.
